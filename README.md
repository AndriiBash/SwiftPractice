# SwiftPractice

## How to run the code?
To run the code, use the `swift` utility in the terminal, an example of running the code:

`% swift <path to file>`

To build the code into an executable file, use the `swiftc` utility in the terminal, an example of creating an executable file:

`% swiftc <path to file> -o <path to save executable file>`
